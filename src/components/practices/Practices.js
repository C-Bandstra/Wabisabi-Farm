        <p className="practices-text">Wabi Sabi Farm is USDA Certified Organic by the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship (IDALS).  No genetically modified crops are grown and no synthetic chemicals are sprayed.  We plant cover crops on fallow ground for soil health, but will also amend this with compost on crop ground.</p>
        <p className="practices-text">We are fortunate to be able to irrigate from a deep well to supplement Nature's rains.  To conserve water we use trickle irrigation to focus the water on the crop rows and not between rows.  In dry years we are able to irrigate to keep the plants alive, but it is Nature's rain that helps crops produce at their best.</p>
        <p className="practices-text">While being USDA Certified Organic by a third party certifier (IDALS), we also strive to grow with a cooperative attitude toward Nature and encourage wildlife on the farm.  We place an emphasis on using more physical controls (bird-netting, re-usable weed fabric, row covers, Surround WSP, etc.) than organically approved herbicides and pesticides (although we do use the pesticides sparingly if needed) as a way to increase our beneficial insect populations and native ecosystems.</p>
